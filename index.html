                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brain dysfunction ranges from complete loss of consciousness to disorientation and an inability to pay attention. The interventions focusing on defining the extent of brain damage and its precise location and exploring personalized neuromodulation technologies are of prime importance. Combining engineering with medical biological sciences to promote health care treatment, including diagnosis, monitoring, and therapy has grown exponentially in recent years. Such as the develop on the neuroimaging technologies and the use of invasive and especially non-invasive neuromodulation.

                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
						IFBDN seeks to strengthen international academic exchange, inter- disciplinary communications and cooperation and aims to foster inspirational dialogues among the world’s leading basic science and clinical researchers. The integrity connection of brain network will display how the brain is impacted in a number of brain disorders, including Stroke, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, Depression, Anxiety, and damage due to injury to specific brain regions. The combination of brain dysfunction and engineering evolves gradually over the developmental course and indicates a potential therapeutic window during which pathophysiological processes may be modified to halt disease progression or reduce its severity.

The Department of Neurology of Shenzhen People's Hospital, as a key discipline in Shenzhen, received three engineering support in 15 years. A team led by Stanford University's Academician Malanga and Prof. Amit Etkin was introduced. Academician workstations and postdoctoral workstations were established. The first precision magnetic resonance, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and high-density brain electricity were the key components in South China. Nerve control center. He has acquired a wealth of treatment experience in cognitive disorders, emotions and sleep, and Parkinson's disease. Today, we are fortunate to have invited many well-known neurology experts from home and abroad to gather in beautiful Shenzhen to share the latest advances in the clinical diagnosis and treatment of cognitive disorders, the construction of neuron-brain networks, and the clinical treatment of neuromodulation in patients with dementia. The health authorities in Shenzhen will, as always, continue to support the clinical research and teaching of cognitive disorders and neuromodulation science in Shenzhen People's Hospital through the Dongfeng of three projects.

This is both the internal demand for the development of disciplines and the construction of the “Three Projects” project in Shenzhen. Gather the requirements of a good medical environment for famous doctors (famous subjects), famous hospitals, and famous clinics. With the support of the “Three Projects” project, our department will introduce “going in and out” as a normal mode of continuous exchange, sending the backbones of departments to Stanford University Medical Center, Sweden Karolinska Geriatrics Center and other top institutions in the world. Conduct academic visits, conduct remote conferences with foreign experts from time to time, and hold 1-2 international seminars each year. Only by actually improving the clinical and scientific research level of the discipline can we better meet the growing needs of the public for medical services and the long-term goals of Shenzhen to build a modern, internationalized and advanced city.
